### :crystal_ball: Our Vision

Our motivation for developing Trip Planner stems from personal experiences that many of us can relate to. Over time, we've encountered numerous challenges when planning trips. Issues like varying budgets, diverse interests, different locations, and preferred vibes among group members often made decision-making quite cumbersome.

To address these challenges, we leveraged the power of AI, specifically ChatGPT, to enhance our trip-planning process. ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, allowed us to streamline decision-making by providing intelligent suggestions based on user preferences and criteria. It’s like having a knowledgeable friend who understands and adapts to each traveller's unique needs.

Beyond just suggesting places, we wanted to enhance the user experience by visualizing their selections. We integrated maps to pinpoint recommended locations and incorporated images to give users a sneak peek into what they can expect.

Through Trip Planner, we aimed to simplify trip planning and make it more enjoyable and tailored to each individual's preferences. 
Whether it's finding the perfect spot for adventure seekers, food enthusiasts, or those seeking tranquillity, Trip Planner ensures that everyone’s preferences are accounted for.

### :bookmark: How we conducted our project

Initially, we conducted a Proof of Concept (POC) phase where we brainstormed various ideas and selected the most promising ones for further exploration. Our focus narrowed down to integrating OpenAI and Google Maps APIs, alongside other complementary libraries.

Implementing these APIs required setting up our development environments from scratch. While our team members possessed diverse skills, web development was somewhat unfamiliar territory. We encountered challenges configuring React, integrating OpenAI for natural language processing, and working with Google Maps API using JavaScript.

Navigating these challenges involved overcoming dependency issues and assisting team members with tasks like resolving merge conflicts on GitHub. This process consumed significant time and effort, yet it was crucial for laying a solid foundation for our project.




### :computer: Our execution

On this platform, you can start by entering the city you wish to explore. Our autocomplete feature instantly suggests cities based on your input, making it easier to find your destination.

Next, select the atmosphere and budget preferences that suit your travel style. These choices are then fed into ChatGPT, our AI companion, which processes your preferences to generate personalized recommendations for places to visit.

While ChatGPT works its magic to curate your itinerary, please be patient as it may take a moment to generate the best suggestions tailored just for you.
